You wake. Behind you is at least a 100 foot drop into a rocky, choppy ocean. In front of you seems a vast forest.
The forest seems to go on forever. You see some areas where the trees thin, and far off in the distance is a signal tower.
Your only options seem to be to go "up" into the forest to the North, or "right" to the forest to the East. |
