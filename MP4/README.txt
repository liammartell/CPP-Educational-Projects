MP4 was the final project of the semester. In groups, we were tasked with creating a text based adventure game. To do this, my team created
an array of different "rooms" and created functionality to move between these rooms. The objective is to explore and escape before
you starve. To escape, you will need to find keys which are randomly generated throughout the map.
