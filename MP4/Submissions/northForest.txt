You are now in the Northern entrance to the forest. There is an air of whimsy about the trees and plant life here. 
The trees smell of cedar and some of the fungus is giving off a faint glow. 
Below you is the cliff you awoke on, to the left is nothing but endless forest, to the right is a house, and above you is a gas station. |
